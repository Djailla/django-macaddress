MAC Address model and form fields for Django

We use netaddr to parse and validate the MAC address.  The tests aren't
complete yet.

Folks, I no longer have time to maintain django-macaddress.  Some awesome
pull requests have come in, I just don't have time to test and merge.
This is mainly due to lack of unit tests(all my fault there).   Please
feel free to fork.  If anyone wants to step up and become the official
maintainer, let me know so I can turn over the pypi package to you.
